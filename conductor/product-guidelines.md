# Product Guidelines

## Communication Tone
- **Professional & Secure**: Our communication focuses on reliability, privacy, and technical precision. We use clear, authoritative language that reinforces user trust in our handling of their sensitive documents.

## Design Principles
- **Glassmorphism & Micro-animations**: We employ a premium, modern aesthetic using glassmorphic elements and smooth micro-animations to create a high-end feel.
- **Privacy-Centric Feedback**: The interface must visually reinforce our "Private by Design" promise. We show users clear indicators when documents are being processed locally to ensure they feel in control of their data.

## Accessibility (a11y)
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: We are committed to making KytePDF accessible to everyone. All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring robust keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and appropriate contrast ratios.

## Error Handling & Notifications
- **Action-Oriented & Reassuring**: Errors are presented in a calm, non-alarming manner using soft colors. We always prioritize providing a specific next step or solution (e.g., "File too large. Try compressing first.").
- **Security-Conscious Transparency**: While we provide enough information for troubleshooting, we deliberately avoid exposing deep technical details or internal error codes that could be exploited by bad actors.
